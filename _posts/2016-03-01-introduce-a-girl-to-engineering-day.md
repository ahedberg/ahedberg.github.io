title: Introduce A Girl to Engineering Day
---

I was the keynote speaker at Nitsch Engineering's
[Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day](http://www.nitscheng.com/?p=5744). This
year's theme was computer engineering, and I spoke about my path to my career
as a software engineer. This was my first professional speaking engagement of
this size. I hope I was able to inspire some of the girls in attendance!
