title: FIRST Robotics Competition Boston District
---

I spent the weekend volunteering at the _FIRST_ Robotics Competition district
event in Boston. I spent a fair amount of time on crowd control, but I did get
to watch some matches. My favorite part: handing out awards at the end of the
competition!
