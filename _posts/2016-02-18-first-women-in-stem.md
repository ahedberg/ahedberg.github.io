title: FIRST Women in STEM Panel
---

I had the pleasure of participating in a Women in STEM hangout with Marissa
from _FIRST_ Tech Challenge today! She had lots of great questions about our
experiences in STEM, and I had a great time! The hangout was recorded, so
check it out on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjLBNGVrhp4)!
