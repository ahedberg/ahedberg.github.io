I'm Ashley, a software engineer at Google. I figured I should finally take advantage
of GitHub Pages and its Jekyll integration. I don't plan on writing regularly, but
I'll update with life events every so often.

If you want to get in touch, send me a message on [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/aehedberg)!
