title: Massachusetts Region IV Science and Engineering Fair Judging
---

Coming full-circle from my own science fair days in high school, I was a
judge for the computer and engineering categories at the
[MSSEF Region IV](https://sites.google.com/site/regionivscifair/home) science
fair! I highly recommend the experience of judging. Some of the students'
projects were very impressive! My favorite: a student who build a guide robot
for his visually impaired mother.
